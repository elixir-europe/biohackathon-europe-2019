background: |
    Following the success of the ELIXIR [Biohackathon2018](https://2018.biohackathon-europe.org/), and building on the [Biohackathons](http://www.biohackathon.org/) organised by National Bioscience Database Center ([NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/?lng=en)) and Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html)), we are planning to run Biohackathon2019 again in Paris on 18th-22th Nov 2019. We hope to build on our success and encourage more ELIXIR and non-ELIXIR participants to take part and also have industry engagement. 
scope: |
    BioHackathon activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, and implement ideas/projects during intensive and productive coding sessions. The topics will be aligned to challenges proposed by ELIXIR platforms (data, tools, compute, interoperability and training), ELIXIR communities (Human Data, Rare Diseases, Marine Metagenomics, Plant Science, Metabolomics and Proteomics), a selection of new tools and communities (e.g., Cytoscape and reproducible networks) proposed by ELIXIR France, and a set of common challenges proposed by the sister [BioHackathon](http://www.biohackathon.org) organised in Japan.
