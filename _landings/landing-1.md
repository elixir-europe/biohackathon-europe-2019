background: |
    [ELIXIR France](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/france) with the support of the [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/) Hub and the ELIXIR interoperability platform and in collaboration with [COST](http://www.cost.eu/about_cost) CHARME, the National Bioscience Database Center ([NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/)) and the Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en/)), is organising a BioHackathon in November 2018 in Paris. This BioHackathon will complement and work in collaboration with the [BioHackathon](http://www.biohackathon.org) planned in Japan at the end of 2018.
scope: |
    BioHackathon activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, and implement ideas/projects during intensive and productive coding sessions. The topics will be aligned to challenges proposed by ELIXIR platforms (data, tools, compute, interoperability and training), ELIXIR communities (Human Data, Rare Diseases, Marine Metagenomics, Plant Science, Metabolomics and Proteomics), a selection of new tools and communities (e.g., Cytoscape and reproducible networks) proposed by ELIXIR France, and a set of common challenges proposed by the sister [BioHackathon](http://www.biohackathon.org) organised in Japan.
